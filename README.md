# ASR-API

## Overview
This project is a FastAPI-based web API for uploading and processing ZIP files containing audio files. The API checks if the uploaded file is a valid ZIP file, extracts audio files from it, and converts them to base64 format for further processing.

## Features
- Upload ZIP files containing audio (`.wav`, `.mp3`, `.aac`).
- Validate the ZIP file format and ensure it contains audio files.
- Convert the audio files to base64 encoding.
- Error handling for invalid ZIP files or non-audio files.

## Requirements
To run this project, you'll need the following Python packages:

- **FastAPI**: For building the web API.
- **Uvicorn**: An ASGI server to serve the FastAPI app.
- **python-multipart**: To handle file uploads in FastAPI.

## Installation
```markdown
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd <your-repo-name>
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   # Install FastAPI
   pip install fastapi

   # Install Uvicorn to run the FastAPI app
   pip install "uvicorn[standard]"

   # Install python-multipart for handling file uploads
   pip install python-multipart
   ```

## Running the API

1. After installing the required dependencies, run the FastAPI app using `uvicorn`:

   ```bash
   uvicorn zipapi:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001
   ```

2. The API will be available at:

   ```
   http://localhost:8001/upload-audio-zip/
   ```

3. You can upload ZIP files containing audio files via this endpoint. The API will respond with a base64-encoded version of the audio files along with a dummy response.

## Usage

### API Endpoint

- **POST** `/upload-audio-zip/`
  
  Upload a ZIP file containing audio files to process.

  **Request**:
  - UploadFile (ZIP): ZIP file containing `.wav`, `.mp3`, or `.aac` files.

  **Response**:
  - `200 OK`: On successful processing of the ZIP file and audio conversion.
  - `400 Bad Request`: If the ZIP file is invalid or contains no audio files.
  
  **Sample Response**:

  ```json
  {
      "code": "OK",
      "message": "Processing complete",
      "dummy_text": "This is a dummy response"
  }
  ```

### Example cURL Request

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:8001/upload-audio-zip/' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
  -F 'file=@<path_to_zip_file>'
```

Replace `<path_to_zip_file>` with the actual path to your ZIP file.

## Folder Structure

- **temp/**: Temporary directory where uploaded ZIP files are stored before processing.
- **unzipped_files/**: Directory where audio files from the ZIP are extracted.

## Cleanup

After processing, temporary files and directories are automatically deleted to avoid clutter.

## Troubleshooting

- If the API throws a `400 Bad Request` error, ensure that:
  - The uploaded file is a valid ZIP file.
  - The ZIP file contains audio files with the `.wav`, `.mp3`, or `.aac` extensions.
  
- If the server is not starting, make sure all required packages are installed correctly.
